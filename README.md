# Crop_Prediction
Developed an end-to-end machine learning-based crop recommendation system that predicts the optimal crop based on soil properties (N, P, K), weather conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall), and pH levels.<br> Deployed as a user-friendly web application using Django for real-time predictions.<br>

<b>Roles & Responsibilities:</b><br><br>
•	Developed a machine learning model to predict optimal crops based on soil and climate data.<br><br>
•	Built a Django backend to process user inputs and generate real-time predictions.<br><br>
•	Designed a user-friendly frontend (HTML/CSS) for data input and result display.<br><br>
•	Deployed the model as a web application using Heroku/Render (if applicable).<br><br>
•	Ensured seamless integration between ML logic and web framework for scalability.<br><br>
